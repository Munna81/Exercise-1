1. *Product Inventory System*:
   - Create a JavaScript object to represent products in a store. Each product should have properties like id, name, price, and quantity.
   - Write a function to add a new product to the inventory.
   - Write a function to update the quantity of an existing product.
   - Write a function to delete a product from the inventory.

2. *User Profile Update*:
   - Create an object representing a user profile with properties like userId, name, email, and address.
   - Write a function to update the user's email and address.
   - Ensure the function can handle partial updates (e.g., updating just the email).

3. *Nested Object Accessor*:
   - Given a deeply nested object, write a function to access a property value given a string path (e.g., "user.address.street" should return the street from the user object).

4. *Object Comparison Tool*:
   - Write a function to compare two JavaScript objects for equality.
   - The function should return true if both objects have the same properties and values, and false otherwise.

5. *Object-to-Array Transformation*:
   - Given an object where keys are student names and values are their grades, write a function to transform it into an array of objects, each with name and grade properties.

6. *Event Scheduling System*:
   - Create an object to represent an event calendar.
   - Each event should have properties like eventId, title, date, time, and attendees.
   - Write functions to add an event, update an event, and delete an event from the calendar.

These exercises will give you a good handle on various aspects of object manipulation in JavaScript, including CRUD operations, deep object traversal, and data transformation.
